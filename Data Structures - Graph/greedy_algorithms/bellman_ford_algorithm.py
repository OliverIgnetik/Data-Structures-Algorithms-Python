# Bellman Ford Algorithm in Python

# Bellman Ford algorithm helps us find the shortest path from a vertex
# to all other vertices of a weighted graph. It is similar to Dijkstra's
# algorithm but it can work with graphs in which edges can have negative weights.

# Time Complexity
# Best Case Complexity	O(E)
# Average Case Complexity	O(VE)
# Worst Case Complexity	O(VE)

# Space Complexity
# And, the space complexity is O(V)

# Bellman Ford's Algorithm Applications
# 1. For calculating shortest paths in routing algorithms
# 2. For finding the shortest path
