# Data Structures and Algorithms Research with Python

## Overview

This repository is language specific with algorithms and data structures implemented in `Python 3.85`. There are Jupyter Notebooks which cover the computer science theory needed in this repository. Also included in this repository, are helpful examples of some high level python concepts such as decorators.

### Data Structures

1. Arrays
2. Graphs
3. Hashtables (dictionary)
4. Linked Lists
5. Stack and Queues

### Algorithms

1. Dynamic Programming
2. Recursion
3. Sorting
4. Traversals
   - BFS
   - DFS
